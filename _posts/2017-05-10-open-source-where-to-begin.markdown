Google summer of code. Linux. Mozilla. LibreOffice. To the general public all these things represent open source. But people cannot be further from the truth, The world of open source is much much much bigger than you can imagine. And for the majority, they have no idea where to begin. You might be a really talented developer or coder, and you may consider open source a distant realm. You always wanted to contribute but didn't. Because you couldn't. Because you didn't knew where to exactly begin. When you google this: how to begin contributing to open source, a million search results are returned and each of them tells you "There are so many organisations. They love contributions. They have IRC channel. Go introduce yourself, they will help you out." And they do help you. But what then. 

That is what this blog article is about. Converting interest into code. 

I think this is the perfect opportunity to discuss how I started. It was around the month of september, 2017. A good friend of mine had been contributing to the open source for quite a while now. All I knew was, yeah there is an organisation, and  he contributes to their project. I didn't get it at first. But then it hit me. 

<h3>"Open source gives meaning to your code"</h3>
The code he was writing was being used by all the people in the world. That was enough of an inspiration to get me started. So I chose fossasia as the organisation. I went to their page on github, saw all the projects. The open-event web app seemed in my domain of skills and I chose it. Now mind this, there were clear instructions on the page, how to get the web app up and running. And yet it took me 12 HOURS !!  So yes, you will have to be patient. Help will be available all around. 
You read the Documentation. There is an error. THAT IS NOT A BIG DEAL!! Instead of stopping there, go google the error. Stack Overflow will be your best friend for the rest of your life, if you do take up development seriously :) 

Now once you have set up the project, you are halfway there. Yes, half the people give up midway while setting up the project. No matter how dumb the question, ask it. That's what the internet is for. The people in the organisation will answer your queries to the best of their ability. 

Now the project is set. The only  thing which  remains is <b> Where to begin? </b>. Though every organisation has different policies, the crux is more or less the same. If they are on github, they will have issues raised, and people usually claim them before working. So you go to the issues list and choose one you like the best and think you have the skills to solve it. Claim it (comment or inform them that you want to work on this). 
Now a beginner's perspective' 101 : <b>  Issue is too small </b> You have to begin somewhere. Edit the documentation. Fix the margins. Never ever think, that such a small contribution won't make a difference. Becasuse it does.

This brings me to my first ever issue which I solved. It was a simple css bug.  Some icons were not aligned where they should have been, and I aligned them.
I wrote exactly seven lines of code to solve it. Out of which 2 were angular braces :+1:

{% highlight ruby %}
	.bookmark {
 	  padding :5px;
 	  position :absolute;
 	  right :0;
 	  top: 0;
 	  }
{% endhighlight %}

This was all, and yet it took my whole day. Why ? No. It's not because I was a novice at css. I got the code right the very first time. Then why it took me that much time. This is where the beauty of Open source lies. I was contributing to a major organisation whose software was going to be used by thousands and  of people at a time. There is so much more than code to it. Indentation. Proper variable any else linting issue you can possibly think of. After finaly making all those changes, when my pull request was finally merged, that was the greates senese of accomplishment I had felt in days. And those seven lines of code had taught me more than I would have learned in months. Using git. Making pull requests. Squashing commits. Using proper tools and conventions. The world is vast, and there will always be plenty of open source projects waiting for you. 
Make your first commit and the rest will be history. Those seven lines of basic css I wrote that day, changed how the next few months of my life shaped out to be. From learning how to use git to my selection in Google Summer of Code 2017 :-): 

PS: The [issue] [issue-ow] I solved still exists and so does the [pull request] [PR].
